# Who is Yves Hanoulle? {#YvesHanoulle}

I originally answered these questions in 2011, I’m keeping these answers, even though some things have changed.
I did answer the extra questions.



**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

I guess by now everybody already knows that I burned down [my parents' house](http://www.slideshare.net/YvesHanoulle/what-i-learned-from-burning-down-my-house). As that does not count, I think another thing that influenced me a lot was the fact that I am born the end of October. Why is my date of birth an influence?  25 October is almost at the end of the year. In Belgium, school classes are created based on calendar years. This means that I was almost 11 months younger then the oldest person in my class. It was not until my kids went to school that I realised how this has influenced me.

Being one of the youngest people in my class, I was always on the tip of my toes to keep up with my peers. This means that today I am very comfortable with going out of my comfort zone. At [Agile Coach Camp Germany in 2010](http://www.jime.co.uk/blog/starting-to-understand-comfort-zones), we noticed that a lot of agile coaches have this personality feature. In that sense I think I am a coach today because my parents decided to let me go to school when they did. (Thank you for that.)

When I was 14, I decided that I wanted to repeat a year. I had exams the last 2 years during holidays, and now I wanted to have a full holiday. [My English, French, and German are not considered good enough by Belgium school standards.]

I told my parents and they accepted my decision.  It's one of the numerous examples of my parents letting me [fail](http://www.hanoulle.be/2011/03/sustainable-pace-failing-in-public/).

It also had an influence on another level. I think that this is part of the reason that I read so much. I did not hang out with friends much when I was young, but I read every book I could. (During a two-year period in my life, I read one book a day.) The fact that I read so many books and stories is visible to anyone that has seen me talk at conferences. When I lead a session, or a keynote, I use storytelling to explain things.

**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

When I finished studying, I went to France working 2 months as a full-time DJ. (I had being doing DJ work while studying.) This was 1994, pre-commercial Internet, pre-social media, even pre-cellphones. The only contact I had with friends was making expensive calls from a pay phone. And, my best friend preferred F2F over phone calls -- how very agile of her.

Being away from my friends made me think really hard about my future. Did I really wanted to have a life of getting up halfway through the day and work until 5 or 6 in the morning? I have some friends playing in Belgium rock bands. I had been going with them to their rock concerts and festivals for the previous 4 years. I knew that my life in these 2 months was more or less the same as theirs. (Or worse because most concerts are finished by 3 a.m.) Yep, life of a rock musician is a lot less glamorous than most people think. They are people with ups and downs, with their doubts, relationship issues, bad hair day, illness... (Oh, and they have to go to the toilet just like anyone else...)

It was not so much the limited amount of money I made. As I had been living off welfare (375 euro a month) for 3 years, I was really happy with the money I made these 2 months.  I was wondering about the hours and the nightlife. Which was kind of crazy, as I was a night-owl(I still am). But I was not sure how I could combine this later with children. I was single and 23 years old. Wondering about how to combine my work-life with children. [Begin with the end in mind](http://www.hanoulle.be/2011/04/long-term-over-short-term/). It was part of me already then. Kind of funny if you see that as a [change artist](http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/47707). I have been popping in and out of planes a lot the last 4 years. Yep, my partner had some tough years supporting our children.

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

As you might have guessed from the last answer, my biggest challenge is keeping my work-life in balance and keeping a sustainable pace. I'm fortunate to be together with a partner who is as stubborn as I am and who pushes back when I start to let my balance move too much into one or another direction.

This is a good thing, because most of my clients and I would say the majority of  working people (maybe I should even add my children with their full lives) share the same problem. This makes it easier for me to understand their problems when I am trying to help them.

**What drives you?**

While doing this, I realise that what drives me for this project is getting to know new people. I'm very excited when I get a proposal to add someone I don't know, or only know by name.

Outside this project, learning new things is the global factor that unites most of the things I have done in my life.

**What is your biggest achievement?**

Being able to look back at [the burning down of my parents' house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yveshanoulle/sets/72157625887770119/), now 20 years ago, and [see it as one of the best events of my life](http://www.satirworkshops.com/workshops/balancing-act/satir-change-model/chaos-transform/). It has become something I am proud of, so proud that on it’s 20 years anniversary I organized an event to [celebrate](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yveshanoulle/5029497245/) the fire. Ok, this is more an achievement of my parents, who never ever blamed me for the fire.

Staying together with [Els](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yveshanoulle/2638995916/in/set-72157605988538006) for the last 15 years is probably the hardest work I have ever done. (A very rewarding one, but hard work nevertheless.)

**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

**What is the last book you have read?**

[_Personal Kanban_](http://www.amazon.com/Personal-Kanban-Mapping-Navigating-ebook/dp/B004R1Q642) as preparation for the [personal agility workshop](http://www.sdec11.com/PostConferenceWorkshop.aspx#PersonalAgility) I created with [Gerry Kirk](http://www.gerrykirk.net/).

[_Liftoff_](http://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Launching-Agile-Teams-Projects/dp/097792016X) by ([Diana Larsen](http://futureworksconsulting.com/who-we-are/diana-larsen)). Seeing the impact of agile retrospectives on my work, this is a book I had to read. And, wow, I think it will have a huge impact on the agile world. I read the draft version but was too late to give feedback to Diana and Ainsley.

[_What's Mine Is Yours_](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Mine-Yours-Collaborative-ebook/dp/B004M8RWFM) -- about collaborative consumption.

[_Training From the Back of the Room_](http://www.amazon.com/Training-Back-Room-Aside-ebook/dp/B001P4N444/). I finally took the time to read this one. (Gerry and I had agreed to use these techniques for our workshop.) I have been using lots of these ideas in my training for years. It's nice to see there is a theory behind it and even better to see how I can improve my training sessions and talks with it.

[_Creating Time_](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Time-ebook/dp/B006U1H0WY): wonderful book about [the core protocols](http://www.liveingreatness.com/the-core-protocols.html). I read the draft of this book to help [Vickie](#VickieGray).

[_Continuous Delivery_](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B003YMNVC0/). One of my clients struggles with this, so I thought I should know more about it.

**Reading right now**: [_How to Run Your Business Like a Girl_](http://www.amazon.com/Your-Business-Like-Girl-Entrepreneurial/dp/1593374550). I bought that book in 2007 to read on the plane back home (together with 7 other books). I finally started to read it on my way to the [AYE conference](http://www.hanoulle.be/www.ayeconference.com). The book is targeted at women, but, hey, I want to learn from women too.

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

_You seem to invest a lot of time into creating [communities](#Communities), why do you do that?_

Creating communities is for me like [asking for help](http://www.liveingreatness.com/the-core-protocols/ask-for-help.html) on steroids. It's win-win-win-win. (win for me, win for the other person, win for the community, win for our clients).

When I started to go to more and more international agile conferences I had no overview of what conferences existed. I did not have time (nor the desire) to keep a personal list up-to-date, but realised I was not alone with the problem. Creating an [agile google calendar](http://www.hanoulle.be/2010/11/agile-conferences-calendar/) and sharing it with everyone that was interested was the natural thing to do.

In this particular case, the "[What's in it for me?](http://www.theleadershipadvisor.com/2011/03/23/whats-in-it-for-me/)" is pretty obvious. I have a Google calendar that has up-to-date information about conferences and [62 people](http://users.elite.net/runner/jennifers/thankyou.htm) help me keeping it up-to-date.

In [ALE2011](http://www.ale2011.eu), [Chris Matts](http://www.hanoulle.be/2011/08/who-is-chris-matts/) reminded me about another advantage: [XPDay London](http://xpday2011.wordpress.com/) used the calendar to make sure that their date did not collide with another conference. (The people from [AgileEE](http://www.agileee.org) go even further, as they put all their options on the calendar.)

If you [look at all the initiatives I started](http://www.hanoulle.be/yves-hanoulle/), they have the following things in common:

  1. I have a personal problem.
  2. I realise I'm not [alone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W52PP3lYlUs).
  3. I create a [walking skeleton](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WalkingSkeleton) version of a solution.
  4. I [share it with my network](https://twitter.com/#!/yvesHanoulle).
  5. I spend a lot of time with my network to refine the solution.
  6. I give my network [free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free) [access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(disambiguation)) to what I created.
  7. They devote lots of time and [energy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yveshanoulle/5156733691/in/set-72157625421130038) to it.
  8. Sometime later, the [network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network) takes over.
  9. I [thank](https://twitter.com/#!/netlash/media/slideshow?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2F6eesfz) the people that donated energy to the project.
  10. I publish the results of the joint effort to the broader community.
  11. When people ask me for a decision, I give the question back to the community to answer.


**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

I want to invite Arie Van Bennekum, as he was also on my original list of Who is agile, yet I did not have his e-adres at the time.
