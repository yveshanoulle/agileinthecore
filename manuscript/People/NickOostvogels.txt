**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

People are surprised when I tell them that I’m quite capable in a fight.  As a kid, I was very into judo, training intensively and competing across the country.  Later on I learned Thai boxing when I was older.  This has influenced my character in a positive way.  It gives you a certain confidence.  You tend to be less anxious in conflict situations and it helps you to stick up for yourself and your family/friends.

**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

As a child I had two career dreams: being a garbageman or a dokter.  Since I can’t stand the sight of blood, I think I would be a garbageman.  Clinging on a driving truck all day, that’s just every boy’s dream, right?  I’m sure you get used to the smell eventually…
On a more serious note, I always loved writing and investigating.  So I think I would have been a journalist.



**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

At this moment, my biggest challenge is finding a good work-life balance.  After quitting my job and starting as an independent consultant, I worked almost non-stop.  I took every opportunity that crossed my path, resulting in 2 profitable years and lots of interesting projects.  Slowly but sure, my body started to send signals that things were going too fast.  I now try to make concious decisions about each new initiative that presents itself.  And off course failing completely so far ...


**What drives you?**

I have always liked challenges.  When I was youg, I always wanted to try new sports and becoming the best.
The same applies to my professional life.  When people ask me if I’m interesting in a new project, I have to contrain myself to not immediately shout YES!  Certainly when the project is complicated.  I have noticed that when things start to settle in a project, my interest starts to fade as well.  That was the reason why I switched to consultancy after working 5 years for an employer.  But even consultancy can be static, that’s why I decided to manage my own schedule as an independent consultant.




**What is your biggest achievement?**

The obvious answer is raising 3 kids, but I mostly have my wife to thank for that.  The fact that 2 of those kids are twin boys makes it even more special.
On a professional level, I’m quite fond of having succesfully started my own company.  Especially since the number of entrepreneurs in my family is quite thin.  Lot’s of them thought I was taking to many risks.  “Why don’t you keep your nice, steady job?”  But so far I’m showing them wrong and I intend to do so even more in the future.


**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

Missing by Everything but the Girl.  Every once in a while, I find that song again in my music library.  And when I play it, it always makes me melancholic.  I don’t know the reason, but it reminds me of my childhood times when I was 16 years old, going to school and having fun with my friends.  It’s amazing how a simple song can trigger those emotions.  Besides that, it is a great song that survives time.


**What is the last book you have read?**

Zero zero zero by Roberto Saviano.  In this book, mr. Saviano maps the entire world of cocaine traffic.  Starting from the drug cartels to money laundering in Wall Street.  He explains how this drug economy has a hughe impact on people’s lives and the global economy.

I chose this book because I love reading non-fiction, specifically about topics that are not at all related to my day-to-day life.  It gives me new insights and food for thought, which is helpful trying to avoid over-specialisation in our business domain.


**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

What is your favourite sport and why?

I practiced many sports in my life, such as skiing, snowboarding, mountainbike, running, fitness, thaiboxing, judo and swimming.  But the one sport I still love and practice the most is soccer.  Playing soccer is physically challenging but also mentally exciting.  Each game, you try to win as a team.  Over the years, it has tought me a lot about team dynamics.  Many of my old teammates are still close friends because we have that history of being in battle together.  That is what I see in many soccer teams.  They end up with a friendship for life.


**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

Anybody, really.  I’m interested in hearing stories from all of them.  Maybe someone I don’t know at all, like Steven Genoe.
