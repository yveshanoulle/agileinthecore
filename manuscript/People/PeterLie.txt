**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

My father was from Indonesia, my mother from mainland China. Both worlds are different but Asian. With Dutch influences I grew up in a multi-cultural environment.
I am curious and like to explore. Traveling (work and private) is one of my main interests. Meet people, explore new countries, and try local food and wine.
As a young boy I visited the neighborhood shopping mall where a domestic appliances store was established. The shop had Bang & Olufsen in their collection. I was so impressed by the design. Years later I bought my first secondhand B&O. Via Marktplaats I managed to buy many more B&O, Nakamichi, Tandberg devices. In the attic I have a small “museum” with my gadgets.
Wine and especially Champagne is great to drink and discover. Each bottle of Champagne has a muselet with a plaque. I am a “placomusofiel”.


**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

Hmmmm, an educated guestimation points out to freelance Scrum Master. Or working at McDonald’s ☺ managing the Big Mac department. Or watch sales man!!

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

My very personal experience of a big challenge is when your situation changes dramatically. In my case it was becoming jobless. Dealing with an unknown situation, no daily (working) rhythm and reinventing yourself to make your day useful.
After 8 months investing time, money and energy in trainings, certifications I found a new job. A well-deserved reward for optimism and believe in a bright future.


**What drives you?**

Change, variety and fun. I am not the kind of guy who has prefers a fixed daily schedule. I like the change and variety in working and private life. Think of change as traveling to places throughout Europe, visiting different customer industries. Variety in using my skills, e.g. pre-sales activities, facilitation, assessments towards coaching, Scrum Master. Using the mix of these skills and techniques drives me.


**What is your biggest achievement?**

I’d rather prefer not to talk in terms of biggest. In life there are many achievements of milestones which are worth to be memorized. Achievements for me are moments to enjoy, capture the happiness of the moment as being part of personal history which becomes nostalgia in future. Some examples to share: first international consulting assignment in Cardiff UK, working at Oracle HQ in Redwood Shores, implementing Agile Scrum with honorable successes. Leisure related: certified SWEN-1 (wine knowledge), certified Tiara Agent (French Polynesia travel agent).


**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

Music brings back memories as we all know. I love Smooth Jazz. When I was working in San Francisco (around 2000-2003), the local KKSF radio station was my favorite while commuting. Just to mentioned a few great bands: Acoustic Alchemy, Fattburger (Title: You’ve got mail), Dotsero (Title: Welcome Home). These are my energizers.


**What is the last book you have read?**

In autumn 2014 I attended a seminar with Jeff Sutherland as key note speaker. He presented his latest book called “Scrum, A revolutionary approach to building teams, beating deadlines and boosting productivity”.
Due to traveling around Europe I prefer to download podcasts to my iPod such as Harvard Business Radio, TED and many more. I listen to these tracks whilst driving or waiting at an airport.



**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**
What is your main hobby/interest?



**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**
