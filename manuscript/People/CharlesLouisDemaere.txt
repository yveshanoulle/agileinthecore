# Who is Charles-Louis De Maere? {#Charles-LouisdeMaere}

**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

Well, this is a difficult question… I have experienced a lot of things already, some have had more impact on me than others, but since I have to discuss something people usually don’t know about me, I think I’ll have to go back some twenty years back, during my late teens.
Like many young boys my age, I went to the scouts between 12 and 18 years. I really liked the time I spent there, because usually at that age we all rather play with teens of our age, but at the scouts we got to do amazing things together in patrols, i.e. a team of 6 or so youngsters between 12 and 18 with most people not your own age.
In the summer camps we went abroad for two weeks. The first few days were dedicated to the building of a woodcraft that would support our tent. We would then use the space underneath to keep our tools and stuff, or maybe build a table. The woodcraft is the most exhausting part of the camp, and usually some scouts try to hide away from the hard work because they feel it’s not really rewarding.
[pics will come]
So, one year, I was patrol leader and - at the start of the camp - an idea sprang out of a discussion with another patrol leader: we would build the best woodcraft ever, by teaming up and building a two-level woodcraft. Now, some twenty years later, I think it must have been a crazy idea, but one thing stuck with me: the scouts leaders believed we would be able to pull this off and never tried to stop us building this! Of course, we made sure we had extra safety in place, and instead of just fixing the wooden logs to each other with a knot, we’d also saw an indentation in the wood for extra safety. However, with this idea in mind, I saw that everyone in both our patrols were really motivated and energized into getting this construction into being! Some members of other patrols even volunteered to help us as soon as they could, it was amazing. I think this was the first time where I really saw how a great vision could energize people to work together for that goal. Also, the scouts leaders could have torpedoed our idea and ask us to build something classical, for fear of accidents or insurance policies, but they didn’t. By trusting us to get it done safely, they empowered and motivated us even more.

Of course, I’m not sure I was aware of those teachings at that point in time, but in hindsight these days have resonated throughout the rest of my life, by allowing me to break the barriers of possibility!

**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I believe my current job is the result of deliberate choices at some key parts of my life. Being an agile coach is something that grew over the years and is so intertwined with my job and life experience that I will ask you to join me into an alternate universe where I never decided to study computer science. So, fasten your seatbelts and follow me through the wormholes of the universe, and meet another Charles-Louis, starring regularly in plays all over Belgium.

In that universe, there would have been no strikes in the schools of the french community when I was in my last year of high school. This means we would have presented “12 Angry Men” at the school’s party. After this experience, I would have launched a few initiatives with close friends, started to befriend theatre managers in the area and play more frequently. I truly believe I would have done everything I can to star in theatre play, since my (real-life) few experiences playing have always been rollercoaster ride of fun!

I enjoy going to theatre plays, because I feel it creates a bond between the audience and the stage that you can’t find when going to the movies. It feels much more real, even though we know the decors are all cardboard. When I play a role, I have to give everything I can to make it believable because there’s no retake. When a partner skips a page of dialogue in front of an unsuspecting audience (true story), it’s up to me to make it seem like nothing happened. It’s a thrilling experience.


**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

Getting people to understand each other, by getting their visions of reality together. It’s not always easy, because I have a certain understanding of the world around me, and you do as well. The key is to try and find where these understandings intersect, and start from there.
As a kid from a french-speaking family living in the dutch-speaking part of Belgium, I’ve always been amazed by the visions those communities had from each other without really trying to make a step towards the other.
I feel like a lot of energy is lost in our daily life by focusing on our differences and enhancing them (I plead guilty). When lost in an argument I feel we should sometimes stop and wonder what the argument is about, take a step back and try to find out what everyone wants to achieve. Then, we are able to discuss in a more efficient way.
Why is it good for me to help people to understand each other? Because I love seeing people happy (see next point), and I’m sure understanding each other is one of the foundations for this.


**What drives you?**

I love to see people happy (see previous point).
Knowing I played a part in their happiness drives me to continue finding the good in people and enhancing this. I know life isn’t always tender with us, and have been on the front row on some of it’s darker performances. However, this shouldn’t be a reason to drop everything and sulk in a corner.


**What is your biggest achievement?**

Being a happy husband and father of three is my biggest achievement. I also [...]

**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**


**What is the last book you have read?**

I’m quite fond of books, as long as they let me explore new settings. Although I’ve read some realistic books, I prefer a light fantasy or science fiction setting. Throw in some humour (like in the novels by Sir Terry Pratchett) and I will read them in one sitting (if possible).

If we’re talking about reading an actual book, it must have been the re-read of “The Ocean at the End of the Lane”, a short novel by Neil Gaiman. I really enjoy his storytelling: he has a way of creating modern fairy tales with just a tiny bit of fantasy meddled in our reality. “The Ocean…” is lovely written, and as usual with Neil Gaiman, expect to be surprised all along.

However, more recently I started to join in on the fun of Audiobooks to listen to while driving. While not technically reading, I have experienced a lot of books through that form recently. The last one has been “Hollow World”, by Michael Sullivan. It’s an interesting science fiction story about a man who builds a time machine that sends him so far into the future that the human race has completely changed, and started living inside the earth in a pacific utopia (or dystopia). I like the fact that the book doesn’t seem to judge the new civilization, but instead opens some interesting questions.

I’ve also stumbled upon a book that’s been a great help for me recently: “The Dream Team Nightmare”, by Portia Tung. It’s a choose your own adventure kind of book that puts the reader in the shoes of a coach trying to save a team having a dip in their agile journey. It’s filled with reusable tips, and the choose your adventure setting allows the reader to make choices and experience the result of these choices.



**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**


**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

I think now might be a good time to ask [Peter Lie](#PeterLie).
