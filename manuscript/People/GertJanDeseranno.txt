**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

What people usually don’t know about me is actually the stuff I don’t like to share.
Retroflecting on what made me who I am – kind of chronologically (without sharing what I don’t like to share:-p);

-       My family

-       Having had a hard time in elementary school being bullied

-       Having a SAFE world of my own to hide in – Chess and strategy games, Music, Woodworking

-       Having had higher education in Limburg (Diepenbeek) where I felt lots of very warm hearted people

-       My new family (my wife, daughter and my wife’s family)

-       Moving to my new house in Budingen

-       My career

 
**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I haven’t got a clue, this job – like the previous jobs – has been on my view of where I would like to be in the next X years.
If I wouldn’t make the jobs I planned out to reach – I would most likely adopt the plans and head somewhere else. If the next target doesn’t work out I might start a shop in furniture?!
 
**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

I have some Spanish blood streaming through my vains, and  when someone or something hits the wrong (right?) buttons I can really react with fire J
Often it is not good, at some moments it is good, but still it is challenging to figure out when and where this fire can be unleashed.
 
**What drives you?**

In my work life: Helping teams become more than the sum of the individuals.
In my private life: Going forward!
 
**What is your biggest achievement?**

I don’t keep count, so I wouldn’t know really, but my gut now says:
In my work life I’m actually very happy to have had the opportunity to start coaching and to be doing ok at it.
In my private life I’m actually very happy that I found a wonderful wife that is able the bear with me and that is my counterbalance on the right moments. Without her I would not be where I am today.
 
**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

I have many of these – because I love different types of music, some for the happy moments, some for the painful moments J
Here are some examples without saying the moments:
Red hot chili peppers – Under the bridge
Clouseau – Oker
Eros ramazotti and Anastasia – Cose Della vita
U2 – With or without you
A lot of Trance, Dance and Techno songs from the 90’s, Nillies and Teens :-p
Newest to party song on the list is Opus - Eric Prydz (woohw)
 
**What is the last book you have read?**

I only read for work (not pleasure literature)
I‘m currently reading Management 3.0
 
**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

What was the most beautiful moment in your life till now?
            Holding Zoë warm, close to me, right after she was born.
 
**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

I would love to read what Ingrid Drouen’s response is to these questions.
