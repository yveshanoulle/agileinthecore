**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

As a kid I was always curious how things work. That meant dismantling toys and tools, trying them out, get them assembled again (or not). I learnt a lot that way and I’m still using this knowledge these days.
I did this of course also with computers and in that way I rolled into studying it at university and making from my hobby my professional occupation.


**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I think I would be a teacher. Most of my family are teachers (my father, my sisters, my brother-in-law, my wife) and I combined my studies with a teaching degree. But I rolled into ICT-projects and never put teaching in practice.



**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

For me it’s difficult to see how the message I send out to people is perceived by the receiver of that message. What I mean is that I’m not sure if the receiver understood and/or felt the same thing as I wanted to express.
Knowing that makes sure that I always think twice before talking and that I try to bring the message well structured and overthought.

**What drives you?**

The idea that you can change/improve things in your personal and professional live by taking small steps, gives me energy. Looking back in time after a period and see the progress overtime is always helpful and proves this idea.
Doing this will automatically encourage you to make new plans for the future and go further on that path.


**What is your biggest achievement?**

4 kids, but my wife did/does most of the delivery.

**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**
‘Rocking in the free world’, Neil Young. Soundtrack of my younger years.


**What is the last book you have read?**

‘De ziel van de stad’ by Jesús Sánchez Adalid. A historical novel about 4 men on a pilgrimage in the Middle Ages to Santiago and how their lives turn into what it is now.


**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

Why do think Cegeka is successful in the agile business?
To my opinion Cegeka played a pioneering role in the agile community in Belgium and gave its employees the freedom to experiment and learn. As a result we built up a lot of agile knowledge and experience which we first used in our own projects in the software factory. This resulted later to the fact that Cegeka is seen as a reference and Agile in the Core is also a success.
The main reason for this success is that management gave trust to its employees and that employees showed entrepreneurship and took up responsibility.

**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**
