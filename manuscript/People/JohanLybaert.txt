**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

I'm the oldest of six children which implied that i was at a very early age in charge of looking after my 3 brothers and 2 sisters. I learned to do this as a team with my oldest brothers - delegating some of the responsibilities. I also learned that some gamification - do small tasks for points helped motivating my brothers and sisters to perform some of the daily tasks. This was from the age of 8 till 14. Those skills, experiences influenced my later behaviour in teams where i was often the natural leader making things happening. 

**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

Interesting question - i get my energy from preaching the word in order to convince people in doing the right thing right. Today i am doing this in our Business world where ICT implemented in the right way can bring a lot of value for the business - if i would have worked in another sector i would probably make people enthusiastic about doing the right thing right or you could say doing with a minimal effort that what is required to get the highest business value - some people would call this agile. So yes i couldn't imagine in doing some thing totally different that what i am doing today. 

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

My biggest challenge is being every day again a small contributor to a better world - being surrounded with positive people enjoying life.  It gives to me the sense of life needed to enjoy life every day again. 

**What drives you?**

I find my drive in the appreciation of the people that i meet at home, at work or under way. It are the people that i met every day that gives me the energy of doing what needs to be done - together achieving results that makes in one way or another a positive difference in this world.

**What is your biggest achievement?**

I don't like the question of my biggest achievement. Achievements are allways the result of a team where each of us contributes based on his or her skills. If i have to name one of the big achievements we did during the last 10 years : it is the agile software factory environment at cegeka applications division where today at least 400 people do high quality software development in a very passionated way delivering the highest business value for our cegeka customers. The results are happy customers willing to talk enthousiast on how we exceeded their expectations.

**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

I have always been a fan of the beatles but my preferred piece of music is "imagine" from John Lennon. I'm also a dreamer and this song provides me with a special meaning of what we could imagine.


**What is the last book you have read?**

The maze runner part 1 by james dashner is interesting by his surrealistic, futuristic story line. I will also read the part 2 & 3 and I wonder how the movie will bring this story live. 

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

How do you see the world future? Being an optimist i see the world evolving into a place where nature will be respected and humans are living together in peace. Of course all what can be automated will be automated in the most agile way and robots will assist people in all what we do. We will travel in space and discover new worlds. Or may be it sounds to much as a dreamer? But in the end that is who I am. 


**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

Please ask Natalie Van der hasselt. She has been an important contributor to agile in the core.
