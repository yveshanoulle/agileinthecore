**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

I love playing roleplaying games. Not the computer games but the good ‘old fashioned’ paper game.  Where you create a character based on your fantasy and a 200 page rulebook J.  I’ve discovered those games when I was about 14 yrs.  With my best friend I played endless adventures all night long – and then falling asleep in school …  Very soon I discovered I liked knowing the game so well that I could tune it to our fantasy – but still keep things balanced.  It was my first encounter with the power of very strict rules – which would later translate into programming.  It evolved so that I was usually the story teller.  I love preparing for every possible angle and keep the story going even when they do surprise me by taking an unexpected turn.  And be able to guide the players into funny and exciting situations while keeping (most of) them from dying trying to get out of those situations again. 
 
Even now I still play the game, with my sons and friends.  I can spend weekends drawing the maps on big flipchart papers for the players to walk on preparing the characters they will meet to have their adventures.  We try to come together every month or so to continue a never-ending story.  While my wife enjoys hearing us laugh and giggle and plot outrageous and/or ingenious ways to ambush that dragon.  
 
 
**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

Something where I could use my persistence, sense for detail and creativity while working together with enthusiastic people.  So I guess most of the engineering professions would have suited me well. 
 
 
**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

Working with other people.  Because I think completely different from most people.  It’s both frustrating (to not being understood) and enriching (in trying to find a way to collaborate).  It puts all my aspects to the test.  My patience not in the least.
 
 
**What drives you?**

Making things easier and better.  
 
 
**What is your biggest achievement?**

Being able to not get my wife to leave me for 22 years already!  She’s my best friend and we keep each other sharp and we have learned to do that in a way so that we deeply respect each other. 
 
 
**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

Ska music.  I just love the ska rhythm.  And one in particular – [dance Cleopatra, dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9UtBxVTgeU) .
   This song is for me the max.  I don’t know why but I can’t sit still when I hear it. 
 
 
**What is the last book you have read?**

A collection of very beautiful fairy tales from Tolkien.  I have an edition that I couldn’t find on amazon, but most of them are in this book as well. 
 
 
**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

What was your favorite game in primary school ?  That would be ‘Einstein, Zweistein und Dreistein’ where my 2 friends and I imagined we were crazy professors inventing the weirdest things.  It usually ended in the whole laboratory exploding. 
 
 
**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**

I’d like to hear more from Ingrid.  She’s always so quiet  ;)
