**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

My career had a double start. I started working in a hospital in an operational role, taking care of people. Here I learned that whatever you do regarding technique, people come first to be successful. After I decided to have a career change, I was still in my early twenties, I became a platoons commander at the Dutch Royal Infantry. Being abroad for 2 weeks in deep winter (-20 Celsius) and responsible for 40 people and a whole stack of hardware like infantry vehicles, I never let that concept go, people first whatever you do.

**If would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

It is very difficult to re-predict a future that is in the meanwhile already the past but....most likely I would have had a role in a hospital as a surgeon.

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

My biggest challenge is to not get bored. Especially when you meet sceptic people who don't want to see what is in front of them and resist innovation, change and new work done. It is good for me because it makes me creative and helps me to innovate the next step. It has helped me to get me where I am.


**What drives you?**

What really keeps me going is that I am an optimist. It has brought me where I am today. I donâ€™t believe in 'can not' or 'yes but'. I know there is always a solution and I am going to find it.


**What is your biggest achievement?**

Personal, father of the wonderful young man and being together with Jacqueline
Business, my role in Agile development, in the Agile community, in writing the Agile Manifesto


**Is there a piece of music that has a special meaning for you?**

So many but I like the athmosphere in Richies Blackmore Rainbow Man on the Silver Mountain from the album On stage and the lyrics in Bram Vermeulens' Ik Heb Een Steen In De Rivier Gelegd 

**What is the last book you have read?**

Nicolo Machiavelli, De Heerser (Il Principe, written 1513-1515, published 1532)

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

The question is "Why does Agile match you?". The answer would be "Because Agile is transparent and coming from best practice. Therefor it feels natural for me to be and do so."


**Whom do you think we should ask next from agile in the core?**
